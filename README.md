This is a Python collaboration between me and Hy Ngo for our
Physics 129L laboratory.

The goal of this program is to simulate 3 masses in 2 dimensions and graph the gravitational contours among them. This was initially done with the [tkinter](https://github.com/python/cpython/tree/master/Lib/tkinter) library but we preferred to use the matplotlib functionality to do it. The script creates a UI where the mass of each particle can be adjusted using a slider and where its position may also be dragged through the GUI.

This project takes inspiration from this [Maple script](https://climate.ucdavis.edu/GravityProblem.pdf) from UC Davis. 

# Current Tasks

- [X] Tokens for each particle
- [X] Position Tracking for each Mass
- [x] Mass sliders for input in GUI
- [x] Writing in Newtonian equations
- [x] Matplotlib render of contour plots
- [x] Integration of Particle Tracking and Graphing
- [x] Patch displays no longer necessary!
- [ ] RPi testing and debugging
