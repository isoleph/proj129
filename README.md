This is a Python collaboration between me and Hy Ngo for our
Physics 129L laboratory.

The goal of this program is to simulate 3 masses in 2 dimensions and graph
the gravitational potentials of those bodies using a click and drag GUI using the [tkinter](https://github.com/python/cpython/tree/master/Lib/tkinter)
python module. This project take inspiration from this [Maple script](https://climate.ucdavis.edu/GravityProblem.pdf) from UC Davis. 

# Current Tasks

- [x] Creating tkinter GUI 
- [ ] Position Tracking for each Mass
- [ ] Writing in Newtonian equations
- [ ] Matplotlib render of contour plots
- [ ] Refinement as needed
