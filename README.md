This is a Python collaboration between me and Hy Ngo for our
Physics 129L laboratory.

The goal of this program is to simulate a 3 body problem in 2 dimensions and graph
the gravitational potentials of those bodies using a click and drag GUI using the [tkinter](https://github.com/python/cpython/tree/master/Lib/tkinter)
python module.
